# Hanz finans
Hanz Finans is a private household account book based on categorizing and analysing transactions.

There may be established [alternatives](#-alternatives), but I wanted to play around and use something between Excel and shiny finance apps.

In its current state, it only runs locally, esp. without any integrations.

## Quickstart  :snail:
The quickest way to get started is using a __VS Code devcontainer__ setup.

The devcontainer comes with the dotnet SDK and some preinstalled VS Code extensions. 

### Prerequisites
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with the extension [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) (`ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`)

### Get started
- When you open the repo in VS Code, the remote extension will suggest reopening the workspace in a container. Do it :)
- Start the server with `ctrl`+`F5`
